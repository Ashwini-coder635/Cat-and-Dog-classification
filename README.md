#Training time reduction using cat and dog classifiaction
Image Resizing: Resize images to a smaller resolution (e.g., 64x64 or 128x128 pixels) to reduce the computational load. Smaller images require fewer operations for each layer in the network.
Data Augmentation: Use techniques like horizontal flipping, rotation, and scaling to artificially increase the size of the dataset. This helps the model generalize better without needing a larger, more diverse dataset.
Data Normalization: Normalize the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1 or use mean subtraction to stabilize the learning process.
Use a Pre-trained Model: Fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet) on the cat and dog dataset. Pre-trained models already have learned features, which reduces the training time significantly compared to training from scratch.
Simplify the Model: Use a smaller or shallower model architecture with fewer layers and parameters. For example, using fewer convolutional layers or reducing the number of filters can decrease training time.
